# Examples

Currently there are three examples to demonstrate the use of the DraftSCAD library. Although they are from the old iterations of this library they have been completely revised and aligned with the present library.

- [Canny Machines Example](cannymachines/example_CM.scad)

  - Demonstrates usage based on the original Canny Machines implementation.

- [Don Smiley Example](donsmiley/example_DS.scad)

  - Showcases examples from Don Smiley's approach to dimensioned drawings.
  - Uses scaling factor for a larger part.

- [UsageSimple Example](usageSimple/usage_samples.scad)
  - Provides simple, minimal examples of available methods for getting started with DraftSCAD.
