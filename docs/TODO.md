# TODO

- Search all `rotate([ 0, 0, 90 ])` and remove to reimplement using the `vert` parameter of `line()`
- Fix text overlap issue with `dimensions()` at large scale
- Better handling of the title and revision blocks to be better parameterized, it shouldnt need to rely on a "templates" folder ideally (this would require siginificant work but that's the direction the development it should take)
